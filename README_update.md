# Debugged Bohmian Density Matrix Simulation

The simulation code has been updated to fix several numerical issues and improve both accuracy and performance. Here's an overview of the changes:

## Major Improvements

1. **Gradient Calculations**: Implemented consistent bilinear interpolation for both wave function and gradient calculations
2. **Numerical Stability**: Added regularization to handle wave function nodes properly
3. **Particle Integration**: Upgraded from Euler to RK4 integration for better accuracy
4. **Boundary Handling**: Improved reflection logic to ensure particles stay in the simulation domain
5. **H-Function Calculation**: Fixed normalization and added proper bin area handling
6. **Simulation Validation**: Added systematic checks to ensure simulation correctness

## Running the Improved Simulation

The main simulation file (`full_density_matrix.py`) can be used as before. It now includes new validation features that will automatically check for common issues.

```bash
python full_density_matrix.py
```

This will run both pure and mixed state simulations with the improved numerical methods.

## Documentation

Two new documentation files are provided:

1. `debugging_guide.md` - Detailed explanation of issues fixed and how to monitor simulation health
2. `IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Comprehensive list of all improvements made

## Analysis Tools

Enhanced analysis tools are included in `analysis_script_improved.py`, providing better visualization and statistical rigor in comparing pure vs. mixed states.

## Example Results

The improved simulation shows that both pure and mixed state density matrices lead to relaxation toward quantum equilibrium, but with different rates and characteristics. These differences may provide insights into how quantum systems behave under different purity conditions.

## Future Work

With the debugged simulation, we recommend exploring:

1. Different wave function superpositions
2. More complex mixed states
3. 3D systems (will require more computational resources)
4. Systems with interactions (modified Hamiltonian)
